\title{
Integrates statistics of differential DNA methylation for a specified
contrast with a network adjacency matrix.
}
\description{
Integrates statistics of differential DNA methylation for a specified
contrast with a network adjacency matrix. Output of this function is
required input for DoEpiMod.
}
\usage{
DoIntEpi450k(statM.o,adj.m,c)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{statM.o}{
The output of GenStatM, or analogous object generated by user.
}
  \item{adj.m}{
The adjacency matrix defining the network of gene relations, e.g. a PPI
network, annotated to NCBI entrez gene IDs.
}
  \item{c}{An integer specifying the desired contrast, i.e. column of
    the contrast matrix. User needs to check which column of statM.o$cont is the one of interest.}
}

\value{
A list with following entries:
\item{statM}{matrix of DNA methylation moderated t-statistics and P-values for the genes in the integrated network}
\item{adj}{adjacency matrix of the maximally connected integrated
  network (at present only the maximally connected subnetwork is used in
the subsequent inference}
\item{avbeta}{average DNA methylation data matrix mapped to unique Entrez IDs}
}
